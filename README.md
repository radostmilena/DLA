# Diffusion-Limited Aggregation
I did a course project on this that followed the procedure in this paper: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.47.1400 a couple of years ago, but the result back then was not very well-written. Basically, it simulated dendrite growth in two dimensions by initializing a grid with a seed in the center and then releasing random walkers on the outer ends that diffuse over the lattice. If they 'hit' the seed, they will be attached or if they touch the boundary of the lattice, they leave the grid. In both cases a new walker is released afterwards. I think it will be interesting to both clean up the old code and also extend the procedure to three dimensions for practice. I also want to optimize the simulation for speed and memory usage.
